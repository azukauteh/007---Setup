## 🛠️ Setup Guide

### 1. **Clone the repository**  
Navigate to the agent directory:

```bash
cd 007---Setup/my-agent
```

### 2. Install Bun 
Bun is a fast JavaScript runtime. To install it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

 verify:

```bash
bun --version
```

> 💡 If you're using Linux, make sure `~/.bun/bin` is added to your `PATH`.

---


### 3. Install dependencies
Run:

```bash
bun install
```

This installs all packages listed in `package.json`.

---

### 4.Configure your `.env` file**  
Create a `.env` file in the workspace root (`007---Setup/`):

```bash
touch ../.env
```

Then add your API key and runtime settings:

```env
# === API Keys ===
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your-google-api-key-here

# === Agent Configuration ===
AGENT_NAME=007
AGENT_MODE=diff-summary
LOG_LEVEL=info

# === Git Integration ===
GIT_AUTHOR=Azuka
GIT_EMAIL=example@gmail.com

# === Runtime Settings ===
PORT=3000
TIMEOUT_MS=10000
```
> 🔐 **Important**: Never commit `.env` to version control. Add it to `.gitignore`.

---

### 5. **Verify `.env` is loaded correctly**  
In `index.ts`, you can temporarily add:

```ts
console.log("Loaded API key:", process.env.GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY);
```

Run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

If it prints your key, you're good to go.

---

### 6. Run the agent 
Start the agent:

```bash
bun run 007    
```

It will stream code review output based on your prompt.

---


## 🧠 How It Works

1. The agent uses `simple-git` to detect file changes in a specified directory.
2. Changes are analyzed by Gemini 2.5 Flash via `streamText()` from Vercel AI.
3. A custom system prompt ensures consistent tone, style, and focus for reviews.
4. Feedback is streamed in real-time to your terminal for immediate insights.

## 🧪 Example Usage

```ts
await codeReviewAgent(
  "Review the code changes in '../my-agent' directory, make your reviews and suggestions file by file"
);
```

This triggers a file-by-file review of changes in the specified directory, with suggestions streamed to your terminal.
